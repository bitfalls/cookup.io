For 3% (38c) of every average meal price (12.75$) people eating out in the US, 3 meals could be provided for people in countries struck by the hunger problem.

**CHEF Tokens**

CookUp app will use CHEF tokens for transactions within its platform. They will be available for purchase within the application by credit cards, Ether (ETH) or other cryptocurrencies.

The CHEF token will be based on the ERC20 standard (Ethereum token) and will be generated during the Token Generation Event (TGE) in the limited quantity of 630 million tokens.

The CHEF token will be a utility token, listed on the most relevant cryptocurrency exchanges, and tradable through purchase and sale, so its value will be determined by the market.
